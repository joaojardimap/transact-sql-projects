🚀 Database Abstraction Layer (Stored Procedures)
I developed a set of Stored Procedures to abstract and streamline core database operations. These procedures ensure data integrity and simplify the interaction with the database by handling:

Simplified Inserts: Automated procedures for adding new records with built-in validation.

Optimized Selects: Custom procedures for retrieving filtered data without writing complex joins every time.

Safe Updates: Controlled update procedures that ensure only authorized fields are modified, maintaining data consistency.
